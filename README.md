This project controls the creation of sections within an organization and the creation of sub-sections within the main sections.
The project also allows sending reminders via email between the main sections and sub-sections in a scheduled manner, meaning each reminder is sent at a time determined by the administrator,
with full control over each section,such as deleting, modifying, and changing the main section of the sub-section.
